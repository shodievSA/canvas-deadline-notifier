## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Canvas Deadline Notifier bot.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
-   [Redis](https://redis.io/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shodievSA/canvas-deadline-notifier.git
    cd canvas-deadline-notifier
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>
    DB_USER=<YOUR_POSTGRESQL_USER>
    DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD>
    DB_HOST=<YOUR_POSTGRESQL_HOST>
    DB_NAME=<YOUR_POSTGRESQL_DATABASE_NAME>
    ```

    -   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`:  You can obtain this token from [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram.
    -   `DB_USER`: Your PostgreSQL username.
    -   `DB_PASSWORD`: Your PostgreSQL password.
    -   `DB_HOST`: Your PostgreSQL host address (e.g., `localhost`).

4.  **Configure PostgreSQL**

    -   Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
